# TravelAgencyExample
A simple website I made to learn more about GitHub and Node.js. This static-site uses Javascript to reveal content on scroll, showcase a modal overly menu and present a mobile drop-down menu for small screens. This gives the site a clean design with more interactivity.

You can view the finished site here:
